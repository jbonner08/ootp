# ootp
Library for automating usage of Out of the Park Baseball's simulation module using PyAutoGui. The resulting HTML reports that get generated by the simulation module are then scraped using Beautiful Soup. Results can be saved as CSVs or inserted into a MySQL DB using SQLAlchemy.

This was last tested on OOTP 21. This library will not work on Linux as PyAutoGUI and the OOTP client do not play well there. This has not been tested on MacOS.

A video of the script in operation can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lofo1RQcCoE&feature=youtu.be
